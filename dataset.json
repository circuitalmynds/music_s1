Rhodes proceeded to co-produce the band's first single, \"Too Shy\" with Duran Duran's EMI producer Colin Thurston. \nThe single was released on 10 January 1983 and topped the UK Singles Chart, having done so before any of Duran Duran's singles (as Rhodes himself has lightheartedly noted).\n\nFollow-up singles \"Ooh to Be Aah\" and \"Hang on Now\" also both reached the UK Top 20, and the group's debut album 'White Feathers' reached No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart. After being the support act for the Birmingham band Fashion in late 1982, Kajagoogoo embarked on their own headlining White Feathers tour in Spring 1983. \n\nWatch our great music videos ❯ https://goo.gl/feVLNN\nMore TopPop?

        "description": "March 16, 1933 - Victor 24347\nAlbert Allick \"Al\" Bowlly (7 January 1898 -- 17 April 1941) was a popular Jazz guitarist, singer, and crooner in the United Kingdom and later in the United States of America during the 1930s, making more than 1,000 recordings between 1927 and 1941.The evening of his death on 17 April 1941, Bowlly and Messene had just given a performance at the Rex Cinema in High Wycombe. Both were offered the opportunity of an overnight stay in the town, but Bowlly opted to take the last train home to his flat in Jermyn Street, London instead. Bowlly's decision proved to be fatal; he was killed by a Luftwaffe parachute mine which detonated outside his flat later that evening. Bowlly's body appeared unmarked: although the massive explosion had not disfigured him, it had blown his bedroom door off its hinges and the impact against his head proved fatal. Bowlly was buried with other bombing victims in a mass grave at the City of Westminster Cemetery, Uxbridge Road, Hanwell, London, where his name is spelled Albert Alex Bowlly.",

        "description": "By the time 1977 rolled around, Barry was experiencing a decline in popularity, his last top 10 single was \"What Am I Gonna Do With You\" a #8 pop hit that topped the R&B survey for one week but that was from 1975. The follow up was the #40 \"I'll Do Anything You Want Me To\" a disappointing showing.\n\nEkundayo and Adeneyi Paris were Los Angeles born brothers who started writing songs together in high school. Ekundayo ended up doing vocal session work for Neil Diamond and BB King and with his brother helped to write \"Sooner Or Later\" a #9 pop hit in 1971.\n\nA few years later Nelson Pigford moved to California in 1973 and met the brothers and found they were able to write songs together, but left to pursue other projects shortly after that. One day, Ekundayo was inspired to write some music and sought out Pigford. They were able to complete the song in one afternoon and then recorded a four track demo. \n\nThey took the demo to the studio to tweak the sound a little when they ran into Billy Page, brother of Gene Page who told them Barry was looking for new songs. They submitted the tape and Barry loved what he heard and set about recording the instrumental track. His touring staff really liked the instrumental version and suggested that he leave it that way but Barry knew with the killer rhythm track he was helping to create a hit.\n\nThe writers did not expect the song to come out the way it did, but were pleased that Barry had put his stamp of originality on it and it quickly ascended the chart peaking at #1 for five weeks starting October 1. It also temporarily reversed Barry pop chart fortunes by peaking at #4 his first top 5 hit since 1974's \"You're The First, The Last, My Everything\" a #2 hit.",
