SYDNEY LIPTON & HIS GROSVENOR HOUSE ORCHESTRA play

Manhattan Holiday

Recorded in London on 13th January 1938

This rather attractive recording by Sydney Lipton's fine orchestra is not of a dance tune but rather reminiscent of a light orchestral piece with a nice build up towards the end. I don't think this recording has ever been reissued, but it is worth reviving.
