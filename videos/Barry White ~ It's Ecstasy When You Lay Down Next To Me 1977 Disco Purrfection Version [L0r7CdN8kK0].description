By the time 1977 rolled around, Barry was experiencing a decline in popularity, his last top 10 single was "What Am I Gonna Do With You" a #8 pop hit that topped the R&B survey for one week but that was from 1975. The follow up was the #40 "I'll Do Anything You Want Me To" a disappointing showing.

Ekundayo and Adeneyi Paris were Los Angeles born brothers who started writing songs together in high school. Ekundayo ended up doing vocal session work for Neil Diamond and BB King and with his brother helped to write "Sooner Or Later" a #9 pop hit in 1971.

A few years later Nelson Pigford moved to California in 1973 and met the brothers and found they were able to write songs together, but left to pursue other projects shortly after that. One day, Ekundayo was inspired to write some music and sought out Pigford. They were able to complete the song in one afternoon and then recorded a four track demo. 

They took the demo to the studio to tweak the sound a little when they ran into Billy Page, brother of Gene Page who told them Barry was looking for new songs. They submitted the tape and Barry loved what he heard and set about recording the instrumental track. His touring staff really liked the instrumental version and suggested that he leave it that way but Barry knew with the killer rhythm track he was helping to create a hit.

The writers did not expect the song to come out the way it did, but were pleased that Barry had put his stamp of originality on it and it quickly ascended the chart peaking at #1 for five weeks starting October 1. It also temporarily reversed Barry pop chart fortunes by peaking at #4 his first top 5 hit since 1974's "You're The First, The Last, My Everything" a #2 hit.
